* There are four simulation models provided on this disk for the MTD3055V 
* power mosfet.  Three of the models are for use with SPICE based simulators 
* and the fourth model is for use with the SABER(TM) simulator from Analogy.
*
* The three SPICE models have identical parameter values and model structure 
* however the syntax is slightly modified in each model to support a variety 
* of SPICE simulators. The SPICE model is based on the available elements 
* in SPICE based electrical simulators and may have limited accuracy and 
* convergence capabilities due to fundamental limitations in SPICE based 
* simulators. Specifically, this model DOES NOT produce an accurate prediction 
* of some non-linear capacitance effects, non-linear leakage characteristics, 
* soft-knee breakdown, weak inversion characteristics, body diode forward and 
* reverse recovery  mechanisms, and maximum device ratings.
*
* The SABER model is a more accurate model that includes all non-linear 
* capacitances, non-linear leakage characteristics, soft-knee breakdown, weak 
* inversion characteristics, body diode forward and reverse recovery mechanisms, 
* and maximum stress ratings. The model is available for use with the SABER(tm) 
* simulator from Analogy and is written in MAST(tm), an Analog Hardware 
* Description Language (AHDL). The SABER model is well suited for power circuit 
* simulation.

* The model for this device is a subcircuit and can be used in the one of the

*
* This model file contains 3 subcircuits with correct syntax for SPICE2G.6, 
* SPICE3C/D.X, HSPICE(tm) and PSPICE(tm). The user must call the proper subcircuit
* in their netlist depending on the simulator they are using, e.g.:
*
* X<name> Nodes<N1, N2, N3> Model_Name
*
* where X<name> is the circuit specific name, Nodes<N1, N2, N3> are the
* connection points for the device and Model_Name is the name of the model
* provided in this model file.
*
* There are 3 nodes for this device.
* The first is the Drain, the second is the Gate, and the third is the Source.
* The Model_Name is: mtd3055vG for Berkley 2G.6 and compatible simulators.
*                    mtd3055vD for Berkley 3C.X, 3D.X and HSPICE(tm) simulators.

*******************************************************************************
* There are four simulation models provided on this disk for the MTD1N60E 
* power mosfet.  Three of the models are for use with SPICE based simulators 
* and the fourth model is for use with the SABER(TM) simulator from Analogy.
*
* The three SPICE models have identical parameter values and model structure 
* however the syntax is slightly modified in each model to support a variety 
* of SPICE simulators. The SPICE model is based on the available elements 
* in SPICE based electrical simulators and may have limited accuracy and 
* convergence capabilities due to fundamental limitations in SPICE based 
* simulators. Specifically, this model DOES NOT produce an accurate prediction 
* of some non-linear capacitance effects, non-linear leakage characteristics, 
* soft-knee breakdown, weak inversion characteristics, body diode forward and 
* reverse recovery  mechanisms, and maximum device ratings.
*
* The SABER model is a more accurate model that includes all non-linear 
* capacitances, non-linear leakage characteristics, soft-knee breakdown, weak 
* inversion characteristics, body diode forward and reverse recovery mechanisms, 
* and maximum stress ratings. The model is available for use with the SABER(tm) 
* simulator from Analogy and is written in MAST(tm), an Analog Hardware 
* Description Language (AHDL). The SABER model is well suited for power circuit 
* simulation.

*
* The model for this device is a subcircuit and can be used in the one of the
* following formats in any spice compatible simulator.
*
* This model file contains 3 subcircuits with correct syntax for SPICE2G.6, 
* SPICE3C/D.X, HSPICE(tm) and PSPICE(tm). The user must call the proper subcircuit
* in their netlist depending on the simulator they are using, e.g.:
*
* X<name> Nodes<N1, N2, N3> Model_Name
*
* where X<name> is the circuit specific name, Nodes<N1, N2, N3> are the
* connection points for the device and Model_Name is the name of the model
* provided in this model file.
*
* There are 3 nodes for this device.
* The first is the Drain, the second is the Gate, and the third is the Source.
* The Model_Name is: mtd1n60eG for Berkley 2G.6 and compatible simulators.
*                    mtd1n60eD for Berkley 3C.X, 3D.X and HSPICE(tm) simulators.
*                    mtd1n60eP for Microsim PSPICE(tm) simulator. 
* Example: X1 1 2 3 mtd1n60eX

* There are four simulation models provided on this disk for the MHD20N06 
* power mosfet.  Three of the models are for use with SPICE based simulators 
* and the fourth model is for use with the SABER(TM) simulator from Analogy.
*
* The three SPICE models have identical parameter values and model structure 
* however the syntax is slightly modified in each model to support a variety 
* of SPICE simulators. The SPICE model is based on the available elements 
* in SPICE based electrical simulators and may have limited accuracy and 
* convergence capabilities due to fundamental limitations in SPICE based 
* simulators. Specifically, this model DOES NOT produce an accurate prediction 
* of some non-linear capacitance effects, non-linear leakage characteristics, 
* soft-knee breakdown, weak inversion characteristics, body diode forward and 
* reverse recovery  mechanisms, and maximum device ratings.
*
* The SABER model is a more accurate model that includes all non-linear 
* capacitances, non-linear leakage characteristics, soft-knee breakdown, weak 
* inversion characteristics, body diode forward and reverse recovery mechanisms, 
* and maximum stress ratings. The model is available for use with the SABER(tm) 
* simulator from Analogy and is written in MAST(tm), an Analog Hardware 
* Description Language (AHDL). The SABER model is well suited for power circuit 
* simulation.

*
* The model for this device is a subcircuit and can be used in the one of the
* following formats in any spice compatible simulator.
*
* This model file contains 3 subcircuits with correct syntax for SPICE2G.6, 
* SPICE3C/D.X, HSPICE(tm) and PSPICE(tm). The user must call the proper subcircuit
* in their netlist depending on the simulator they are using, e.g.:
*
* X<name> Nodes<N1, N2, N3> Model_Name
*
* where X<name> is the circuit specific name, Nodes<N1, N2, N3> are the
* connection points for the device and Model_Name is the name of the model
* provided in this model file.
*
* There are 3 nodes for this device.
* The first is the Drain, the second is the Gate, and the third is the Source.
* The Model_Name is: mhd20n06G for Berkley 2G.6 and compatible simulators.
*                    mhd20n06D for Berkley 3C.X, 3D.X and HSPICE(tm) simulators.
*                    mhd20n06P for Microsim PSPICE(tm) simulator. 
* Example: X1 1 2 3 mhd20n06X
